KEY PROJECTS AND SEMINARS
M.Tech Dissertation | Guide: Prof. Satyanarayana Murty Dasaka, IIT Bombay
[July ’20-ongoing]
Understanding the Behaviour of an Anchored Rigid Retaining Wall by Back Analysis
Analyse the forces acting on a cantilever retaining wall with counterforts and obtain the movement of the
•
wall required to attain the active earth pressure condition, under varying site conditions and soil types.
Analyse retaining wall with anchors and find the required spacing between anchors
•
Numerically model the load-deformation behaviour of anchors using PLAXIS .
•
Understand the short-term and long-term behaviour of retaining walls.
•
Identify the causes of failure of retaining wall, and develop guidelines on preventing such failures in future.
•
M.Tech Credit Seminar | Guide: Prof. Satyanarayana Murty Dasaka, IIT Bombay [Jan ’20 – June ‘20]
Application of Geosynthetics in Pavements on Expansive Soils
Reviewed literature on the field and laboratory studies on expansive soils and studied the effectiveness and
•
suitability of using geosynthetics in remediating the problems related to pavements on expansive soils.
Understood the cause and types of pavement distresses on expansive subgrades
•
Understood the mechanisms of geosynthetic reinforcement and assessed the future scope of works required
•
B.Tech Project | Guide: Prof. Ajitha A. R., College of Engineering Trivandrum
[2018]
Design and Analysis of Reinforced Earth Retaining Wall
Designed and compared the cost of construction of a Reinforced Earth retaining wall ( RE wall ) and a
•
Reinforced Cement Concrete ( RCC ) retaining wall for same soil conditions and height
About 47% cost savings in using an RE wall in the place of an RCC wall
•
B.Tech Seminar | Guide: Prof. Ajitha A. R., College of Engineering Trivandrum
[2017]
Sustainable Design Criteria for Earthquake Region
Reviewed literature on approaches that enable post-event functionality in earthquake -prone regions,
•
resulting in more sustainable structural systems.
Survey Camp | As a part of the Undergraduate curriculum
[2017]
Conducted survey of a portion of the College of Engineering Trivandrum campus, using Total Station .
•
Developed a topographic map with contour lines using LisCAD and AutoCAD .
•
Course Project | Guide: Prof. Ashish Juneja, IIT Bombay [November 2019]
Finite Element Analysis Using PLAXIS 2D | (Course: Geotechnical Constitutive Modelling)
•
Modelled a raft foundation to a circular water tank resting on a soft clay deposit using PLAXIS 2D to analyse
the consolidation behaviour before and after cement stabilisation of soft clay.
•
The analysis showed that the factor of safety increased by around 4.7 times, the time required for 95 %
consolidation has reduced and the settlement was brought below the allowable limit post stabilisation.

Course Seminar | Guide: . B.V.S. Viswanadham , IIT Bombay
