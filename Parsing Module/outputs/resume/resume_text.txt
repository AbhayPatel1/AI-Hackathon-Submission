Buy Leads Enrichment and Prediction using Advanced
Data Analytics (Buy Leads: Online buyer requirements)
Performed CostBenefit Analysis of AutoRejection of Intent generated leads by matching product name with its secondary micro category
Impact: Saved 8440 genuine leads/week from deletion by suggesting not to implement auto rejection inside the system
Developed, analyzed and initiated the implementation of Automatic
Product Mapper to map a product to its most relevant Micro Category
Considered maximum string match (of product name with Mcat name) and maximum no. of leads for that Mcat in previous 3 months data
Impact: Resulted in >100% increase from 142 to 321 leads per product when compared to the existing search algorithm on IndiaMart portal
Performed Text Analytics to create an extensive database of most recurred Brands for a particular Micro category of products
YavTech LLC (Washington DC, USA) (Dec 2015)
Developed a Linear Regression model in R for the prediction of Future Stock prices of a company based on its past financial data
Modeling factorsused for the prediction were GDP (Economic Growth), Interest rates, sector specific factors such as P/E ratio and company

Credit Card Fraud Detection using
Machine Learning Algorithms (Under Graduate Project) (JanApr 2017)
Dataset consisted of 284, 807 tuples and 28 features with only 492 cases of frauds ( 0.172% ) leading to the problem of class Imbalance
Applied SMOTE to handle Class Imbalance problem and used Confusion matrix and ROC curve for quantification of accuracy of the model
Performed classification using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines and Adaboost
Result: On considering the tradeoff b/w accuracy and specificity, Decision tree performed best with 95.27% accuracy and specificity of 95.6%
Prediction of Fuel Flow rate of an Aircraft during different phases of a Flight (
Data Mining - IME672A) (JanApr 2017)
Applied
Data preprocessing techniques and PCA for dimensionality reduction on data taken from live competition on CrowdAnalytics.com
Modeled using Lasso and Ridge Regression , Regression Tree , Artificial Neural network and Ensemble methods ( Random Forest and XGBoost )
Result: Ensemble Methods performed better with RMSE of only ~2.6% compared to ~ 5% error rate obtained using other methods
Time Series Forecasting model for Quarterly RBI lending rates (Statistical Modelling for Business Analytics - MBA652A) (JanApr 2017)
Approach1: Forecasted the RBI lending rate using ARIMA model, plotted Autocorrelation function to quantify the optimum no. of lags
Approach2: Performed Autoregressive Distributed Lag Modeling of Interest rate with AR1 and Inflation rate of Immediate next quarters
Result: Established that the current RBI lending rate depends significantly on the rate during the previous quarter for Autoregression
Model resulted in a positive correlation between change in Inflation rate and change in Interest rate with a lag order of 2
Concluded from this lag of order 2 that the Policy changes by government for countering inflation do not come into effect immediately
