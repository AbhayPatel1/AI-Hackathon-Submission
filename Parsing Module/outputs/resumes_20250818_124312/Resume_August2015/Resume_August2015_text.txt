 PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN AT COLLEGE LEVEL
Project Title
Mathematical Computation of Thermal Modeling of EN31 Steel machined with
(Masters of Technology)
CVD coated carbide insert for turning process using MATLAB programming
Analytical models capable of determining temperature rise distribution at work piece and chip due to combined effect
of deformation zones during machining are simplified in a step by step manner along with relating them with basic
machining parameters with the help of MATLAB programming. The coding is validated with already developed results
of scientists for various machining parameters. The coding serves as generalized algorithm to generate temperature
rise contour graphs with respect to various coordinates of work piece and chip for any set of machining parameters in
few seconds.
The developed coding is used to determine temperature rise distribution at work piece and chip of EN31 Steel when
machined with MTCVD coated carbide insert. Total 27 experiments were performed with various combinations of
cutting parameters to obtain input parameters like cutting forces (dynamometer), chip thickness (Vernier) etc. These
input parameters are used to calculate other input parameters like shear angle, friction angle, other developed forces,
tool-chip contact length etc. Contour graphs are developed using obtained input parameters and tabulated to
compare variation of temperature rise and cutting forces with respect to cutting parameters.
