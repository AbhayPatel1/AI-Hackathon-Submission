This was achieved by auto labelling high confidence records using our ML models.\n• Java, Python, TypeScript, AWS Step Functions, AWS Batch, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, EC2, SQS, SNS, AWS CDK,\nAWS Athena, Elastic Search, LightGBM, TensorFlow\nMorgan Stanley, Bangalore\nTechnology Assosciate\n• Built a visualization tool to group contextually related infrastructure alerts (issues) to reduce the Mean Time to Resolu-\ntion. Modeled the infrastructure dependencies as a graph problem and used graph algorithms like BFS, Union-Find to\nshow the visualization and identify the root cause for a bunch of alerts.\n• Developed a Machine Learning powered solution to predict the likelihood of a production deployment resulting in an\nemergency reversion.\n• Python, Flask, ReactJS, Redux, Angular, d3, Kafka, DB2, scikit-learn",

Implemented spelling correction and auto-suggestion using\nedit distance algorithm. Used web scraping to get the data for online lookup. Python, BeautifulSoup.\n• Alternative-Routes in Road Networks (2016): Applied Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm to find the route which takes\nthe shortest time to travel from source to destination in a given road network with randomly generated traffic. Imple-\nmented methods to avoid collisions between vehicles by dynamically changing their speeds. Used C++ and OpenGL\nlibrary for simulation. C++, OpenGL\n• Clustering SSH Attacks (2016): Applied KMeans clustering algorithm to segregate different kind of attacks during a\nSecure Shell (SSH) session by making use of network packet files(pcap). It involved finding the best value of K and\ngrouping the similar files on the basis of cluster assignments.
