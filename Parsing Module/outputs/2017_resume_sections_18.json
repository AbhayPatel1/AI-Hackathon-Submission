The system consists of cryo-chillers, a\nvacuum-sealed valve system, and cooling ring to cool the implant mechanism.\n•\nConducted and documented characterization tests for Crion by validating cool down rate, throughput, wafer\ntemperature uniformity and overall functionality of the system.\n•\nOperated the tool during 40 continuous hours of reliability growth testing and helped release the product from R&D\nto Production.\n•\nSupported customer escalations by analyzing archives from the field and determining root cause of the customer\nproblems.\n26-Wafer Implementation\n•\nLed the project with a team of mechanical engineers, an electrical engineer and software engineers to create new\nhardware as well as software controls to implement the platen warm-up process. Released the hardware through\nECO process to Production and conducted tests to help with software release.\nCenter for Earthquake Engineering Simulation\nTroy, NY\nResearch Engineer\nJan 10-Sept 2010\n•\nOperated and troubleshot earthquake simulation machinery (centrifuge) while conducting experiments.\n•\nstrain gauges, accelerometer, and pressure sensors.",
